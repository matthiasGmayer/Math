# Math
A C# Math Library, that contains Linear Algebra.  
It is required for some of my Projects.  
It contains generic N-dimensional vectors,  
as well as generic MxN matrices with all functional operators, such as multiplication and addition.  
It can solve an arbitrary linear equation system, in form of:  
e.g.  
|3x + 4y +5z = 3|  
|5x + 3y +7z = 2|  
|2x + 8y +9z = 1|  
represented as a Matrix:  
|3 4 5 3|  
|5 3 7 2|  
|2 8 9 1|  
It also contains simple 2D geometry, such as rectangles, circles and lines, with basic functionalities like distance functions.
